# PlayOnUru
A collection of PlayOnLinux/PlayOnMac scripts to install Uru Live and shards

<b>Uru Live</b>: currently is set to launch in a virtualized window, to prevent Wine from taking control of the whole screen. An alternative is to create the Uru Live folder in the Documents folder and copy there the <i>config.ini</i> file, which is set to windowed mode with minimum graphic settings.

<b>Minkata</b>: it assumes the presence of the Uru Live wineprefix, to copy files from there. Same video issues as Uru Live.

<b>The Open Cave</b>: it manages to load the login window, but fails to downloads a few files.

<b>Gehn Shard</b>: same issues as The Open Cave.
