# PlayOnUru
A collection of PlayOnLinux/PlayOnMac scripts to install Uru Live and shards.

<b>Minkata</b>: it assumes the presence of the Uru Live wineprefix, to copy files from there.

<b>The Open Cave</b>: the script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix, if it exists, otherwise it installs Uru Live, then TOC on top of it.

<b>Gehn Shard</b>: works as the TOC script, but currently has issues copying data from the Uru Live prefix.
