# PlayOnUru
A collection of PlayOnLinux/PlayOnMac scripts to install Uru Live and shards.

<b>Minkata</b>: it assumes the presence of the Uru Live wineprefix, to copy files from there.

<b>Gehn Shard</b>: the new script first install Uru Live, then Gehn on top of it. The old script manages to load the login window, but fails to downloads a few files. Using the "/image" argument from <i>Configure</i> once should fix that. The script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix. Loading can be slow.

<b>The Open Cave</b>: same issues as the old Gehn script.
