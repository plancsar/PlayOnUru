# PlayOnUru
A collection of PlayOnLinux/PlayOnMac scripts to install Uru Live and shards.

<b>Minkata</b>: the script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix, if it exists, otherwise it installs Uru Live, then Minkata on top of it.

<b>The Open Cave</b>: the script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix, if it exists.

<b>Gehn Shard</b>: the script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix, if it exists.
If the game fails to delete the old patcher executable, just keep trying relaunching it, after a couple of attempts it should manage.

<b>Deep Island</b>: currently based on the GOG installer only. The first time you launch the game, you'll get a few error alert, but you should be able to ignore them and continue.
