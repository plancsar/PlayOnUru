# PlayOnUru
A collection of PlayOnLinux/PlayOnMac scripts to install Uru Live and shards.

<b>Minkata</b>: the script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix, if it exists, otherwise it installs Uru Live, then Minkata on top of it.

<b>The Open Cave</b>: the script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix, if it exists.

<b>Gehn Shard</b>: the script tries to copy the data files from the Uru Live prefix, if it exists [<i>currently doesn't seem to work on macOS</i>].
If the game fails to delete the old patcher executable, just keep trying relaunching it, after a couple of attempts it should manage.
